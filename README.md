# online-art-gallery

We’re developing an online art gallery designed to provide artists with a global platform to showcase their works. This gallery will feature interactive 3D tours, allowing visitors to explore the exhibits virtually. Each artwork is accompanied by detailed cultural context to enhance the educational experience.

The platform will also offer a user-friendly interface for artists to upload, manage, and sell their pieces, as well as tools for curators to organize and display exhibits in a dynamic and engaging way. Our vision is to combine technology, art, and culture to bring an immersive experience to a worldwide audience.







Stakeholders and Roles
Four key roles make up the ecosystem of this project:

Admin
The admin will manage the platform’s content by adding or removing artworks, assigning roles (such as curators and artists), and ensuring the smooth running of the platform.

Artist
Artists can upload and manage their work, including setting prices and providing descriptions. They’ll have access to sales analytics and a portfolio that potential buyers can view in the virtual galleries.

UPLOAD AND ADMINISTER THEIR WORKS, INCLUDING DESCRIPTION AND PRICE.

Sales analytics and activity from a user perspective

portfolio and hence makes contact with potential buyers in virtual galleries

Visitor
Visitors can explore the gallery through virtual tours, read the cultural context of any artwork, purchase pieces, and even interact with artists by commenting on artworks. They can also participate in community activities.

Curator
Curators are responsible for selecting artworks for display and organizing exhibitions, ensuring the gallery stays fresh and captivating. They can also provide educational insights on the artworks being showcased.

Admin Panel:

Manage user accounts, like assigning different role types such as Artist, Curator, Visitor

Gallery settings: Opening hours of virtual tours, Exhibition highlights.

Publish content for systems (publish new exhibitions, featured artworks).

Artist Dashboard:

This is where the artist will upload his artworks images, videos, and text) and manage his listings.

Communicate with potential buyers; respond to queries.

Analytics dashboard: sales, visitors etc

Visitor Interface:

Users will be able to navigate the virtual gallery, stroll through virtual tours, interact with artists

Shopping carts offers selling art.

A personal bookmark section to bookmark favorite works and create their own virtual collections.

Curator Console:

Organize exhibitions by choosing and placing the artworks in the gallery.

Manage layout and theme of each exhibition.

Be able to offer some expert commentary on every artwork added for educational value.

Block Diagram / System Architecture




This section must contain a diagram showing the system's architecture:

Frontend: Built using React.js. The interface for visitors, artists, and curators.

Backend: Node.js and Express.js, where user requests, uploads for art, and data processing;

Database: Using MongoDB to store user data, artwork metadata, and sales transactions

Virtual Tours: Managed using WebGL and Three.js for creation of 3D interactive experiences

Hosting/Deployment: The prototype can be deployed on AWS or other cloud providers for scalable performance.

Prototype Design

You may add a prototype design video or images in this section showing exactly what the application will look and work like. This might include such items as an artist's dashboard view to indicate how they can upload their works and control sales, a virtual gallery tour view to show how users can navigate the gallery space and interact with the artwork, and a visitor's interface that can highlight the details of the artwork and purchasing options.




Technologies to Be Used

The project is composed of a hybrid mix of the most cutting-edge technologies:

Frontend:

React.js: it is used for the building of the user interface.

HTML5/CSS3: For structuring and styling of the app.

Three.js and WebGL: For rendering 3D elements and virtual tours.

Backend:

Node.js with Express.js: For the backend server and APIs.

MongoDB: For managing and storing data about users, artworks, as well as sales.

Hosting/Cloud Services:

AWS (Amazon Web Services) or similar cloud solutions for scalability and high availability.

Deployment Tools:

GitHub with version control, and Jenkins/Docker for CI/CD pipeline management.

Other Tools:

Stripe/PayPal payment integration to use to buy artworks.

Google Analytics for tracking engagement and behavior on the site.

Implementation Video / Deployment Link of Project Front-end:

If possible, include a live demo of the site or video walkthrough demonstrating how users can interact with the gallery:

Demo Link: Include a link to a deployed version of the front-end if ready.

Video Walkthrough: A short video demonstrating the browsing behavior of visitors going through the gallery, how artists upload their work, and curators organize exhibitions

Prototype Design Link

This may include:

A Figma link or similar tool with proto-type designs.

A video demo link to the proto-type

You can also append screenshots of the design to your article.

Conclusion

The project introduces a novel and exciting way through which artists and art lovers experience more about art in a virtual space. By offering a highly engaging platform, this virtual gallery increases accessibility to art along with an ultra seamless and modern user experience. The project will meaningfully interlink the artists, curators, and visitors through advanced technologies, such as WebGL for virtual tours and intuitive user interfaces. We will expand the features and provide more immersive experiences for users worldwide by the end of the project course.
